            It is important to understand the cost of replacing our aging fleet, which is dependent on federal bus and bus facilities funding and to compare it to the funding we are receiving for those purposes. As you can see in this chart, the cost of replacing our aging buses far exceeds the funding that is provided through the current authorization, MAP-21, as well as what we will receive under the Senateâ€™s authorization bill, the DRIVE act.

        As stated previously, portions of our fleet reach replacement status in batches. Under current law, many agencies can only replace a fraction of one vehicle using their apportionment of Sec.5339 Bus & Bus Facilities formula funds.
    </p>
    <p>
        At {{data.basic_info.name}}, we currently have {{data.totals.vehicles}} in our fleet. Between the years {{year}}-{{year+6}}, we anticipate {{data.totals.replacements}} vehicles will reach their FTA determined useful life and will need replacing at a cost of ${{data.totals.cost}}. During that same time period, we expect to receive ${{data.totals.donations}} from the Sec.5339 Bus & Bus Facilities formula program.
